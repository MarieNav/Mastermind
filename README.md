## Project Week 1 - Coding our proper verison of mastermind

In this repository, there are : 
- our presentation Power-Point file

## Project Description
Using basics python ressources we learnt in this first week, we worked remotely to create a mastermind game.
This software is able to take an input from the user and provide an output.

## Rules
Itâ€™s a one player game.The computer generates a random secret code. The player has to guess it in limited rounds.
In the original game, the code is composed by colored balls we replaced by numbers. 
To increase the difficulty, it possible to modify numbers of digits, colors and/or rounds.

## Workflow
We plan our project on Trello, where we wrote the pseudocode.

## Organization
We got inspired from our courses and from code existing on internet and we improved it our way.
